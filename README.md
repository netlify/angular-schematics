# üíô Netlify Schematics for Angular ‚ú®

This project exists to help you integrate Netlify into your Angular project and make your development process a little bit easier ‚ô•.

## What These Schematics (currently) Do

For now, this schematic will generate a [Netlify configuration file](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/file-based-configuration/?utm_source=project-repo&utm_medium=netlify-schematics_tzm&utm_campaign=devex) (`netlify.toml`) that will help aid in the deployment process and help you skip a few inputs if you're using the [Netlify CLI](https://docs.netlify.com/cli/get-started/?utm_source=project-repo&utm_medium=netlify-schematics_tzm&utm_campaign=devex).

## Adding Netlify Schematics

To add these schematics simply run the following command in your Angular project:

```bash
ng add netlify-schematics
```

You'll be prompted to add a few bits of information:

- [project's build command](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#definitions?utm_source=project-repo&utm_medium=netlify-schematics_tzm&utm_campaign=devex): for Angular projects this is usually `ng build` or for production `ng build --prod`.
- [directory of your build project](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/get-started/#definitions?utm_source=project-repo&utm_medium=netlify-schematics_tzm&utm_campaign=devex): when you run your build command where does the built project live (for Angular it's `/dist/<project name>` for Angular + [Scully](https://github.com/scullyio/scully/blob/master/README.md) prerender it's `dist/static`)

> üìù Note: none of these properties are required if you do not add them the two files will still be generated, but they will have blank spots where your answers would be.
